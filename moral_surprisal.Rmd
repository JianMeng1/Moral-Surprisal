This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
# Load libraries
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read your data
data <- read_excel("surprisal data.xlsx", sheet = 1)
colnames(data) <- trimws(colnames(data))  # Clean up column names

# Compute summary stats by condition
summary_stats <- data %>%
  group_by(item.type) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_surprisal = mean(Surprisal, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_surprisal = sd(Surprisal, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print the result
print(summary_stats)

```

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readxl)   # for reading Excel files
library(dplyr)    # for data manipulation

# Read the Excel file (assumes the data is in the first sheet)
data <- read_excel("surprisal data.xlsx")

# Optional: Check column names to make sure they match what you expect
# colnames(data)

# Filter surprisal values by item type
surprisal_A <- filter(data, item.type == "A")$Surprisal
surprisal_C <- filter(data, item.type == "C")$Surprisal

# Perform t-test
t_test_result <- t.test(surprisal_A, surprisal_C, alternative = "less")


# Print result
print(t_test_result)
```


```{r}
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)

# Read your Excel data again (if needed)
data <- read_excel("surprisal data.xlsx", sheet = 1)
colnames(data) <- trimws(colnames(data))  # Clean column names

# Boxplot
ggplot(data %>% filter(item.type %in% c("A", "C")), 
       aes(x = item.type, y = Surprisal, fill = item.type)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Surprisal by Condition (A vs C)",
    x = "Item Type",
    y = "Surprisal"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("A" = "skyblue", "C" = "salmon"))

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
